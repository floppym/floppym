		Oxygen-Gtk is a port of the default KDE widget theme (Oxygen), to gtk.

		It's primary goal is to ensure visual consistency between gtk and
		qt-based applications running under kde. A secondary objective is to
		also have a stand-alone nice looking gtk theme that would behave well on
		other Desktop Environments.

		Unlike other attempts made to port the kde oxygen theme to gtk, this
		attempt does not depend on Qt (via some Qt to Gtk conversion engine),
		nor does render the widget appearance via hard coded pixmaps, which
		otherwise breaks everytime some setting is changed in kde.
